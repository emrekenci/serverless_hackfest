# Azure Serverless Hackfest

![Azure Serverless Workshop](workshop.png "Azure Serverless Workshop")

## Overview

We are delighted to invite you to participate in an exclusive Microsoft Hackfest for Serverless technologies on Azure.

The technologies we will cover are:
* [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
* [Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/)
* [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/)

Developers are looking to leverage the new paradigm of serverless architectures: scalable and reliable event based compute experience for code and workflows, which accelerate the development of applications while simplifying the infrastructure, providing auto-scale and micro-billing, using technologies like Functions, Event Grid and Logic Apps

Because of the hands-on nature of the event there is limited space in the Serverless-palooza; register to reserve your spot.

## Readiness

You must have access to either an Azure Subscription or Resource Group that you are either an Account Admin, Owner or Contributor.

You must have visual studio 2017 installed and upddated with Azure development workload.
